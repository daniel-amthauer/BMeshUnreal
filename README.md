# BMeshUnreal
An Unreal Engine plugin to make runtime procedural mesh generation more flexible. Based on BMesh for Unity (https://github.com/eliemichel/BMeshUnity)

## Requirements
Requires Unreal Engine 4.25.x or greater

## Installation
Copy the BMesh folder to your project's Plugins folder. The editor should prompt you to compile the plugin when opening your project.
If you're using Git as your source control, you can also add the repo (or a fork of it) directly as a submodule to your Plugins folder.

## Usage
See [`UBMeshTestComponent`](https://github.com/daniel-amthauer/BMeshUnreal/blob/master/BMesh/Source/BMeshTest/Private/BMeshTest.cpp) in the BMeshTests module for examples of how to create meshes with it and how to visualize them in the editor. 

## Future work 
~~- Conversion to RuntimeMeshComponent~~
- Blueprint usage examples
- In-editor conversion to StaticMesh
