# BMeshUnreal
An Unreal Engine plugin to make runtime procedural mesh generation more flexible. Based on BMesh for Unity (https://github.com/eliemichel/BMeshUnity)

## Requirements
Requires Unreal Engine 4.25.x or greater

## Installation
Copy the BMesh folder (from inside the Plugins folder) to your project's Plugins folder. The editor should prompt you to compile the plugin when opening your project.

## Usage
See [`UBMeshTestComponent`](https://github.com/daniel-amthauer/BMeshUnreal/blob/master/Plugins/BMesh/Source/BMeshTest/Private/BMeshTest.cpp) in the BMeshTests module for examples of how to create meshes with it and how to visualize them in the editor. 

## Future work 
~~- Conversion to RuntimeMeshComponent~~
- Blueprint usage examples
- In-editor conversion to StaticMesh
